# Nobody's Space
## A space exploration game

I made a 2d platformer engine and didn't know what to do with it, so I ignored it for a while. Then I made an Asteroids clone and didn't know what to do with it for a while. Then, I realised that I could duct tape the two to have a space exploration game.

### Features
- Fly around space
- Land on planets
- Build your own universes by making a JSON file with planet data and a text file with the layout for each particular planet
- Neato Graphfixz
- Free and open source
- No lootboxes

### Controls
#### Space controls:
- Up arrow key to accelerate
- Left and Right to turn
- Down arrow key to land at a planet

#### Ground controls:
- Left and right arrow keys to walk around the planet
- Up arrow key to jump
- Space key to respawn after dying
- Down arrow key to leave the planet

### Planned features
- When you land on planets, your ship will actually land on the planets and you'll have to locate and return to your ship to leave
- You will land on planets at a random position with walkable land, rather than in the same place every time.
- Your ship will be equipped with a radar to locate offscreen planets
- You will be able to somewhat freely move your camera when on a planet

### Features that are cool, but I don't know if I'll get around to implementing them
- Perhaps I will draw an actual player sprite for your player and not just a square with a dot in it
- Maybe I can implement a system to make "gadgets" that the player can use on planets.
- Maybe these gadgets will be scriptable via the Lua scripting language

### Release date and price
In Q4 of 2021, it will show up on Steemue and in your local GameShackotron priced at $60 for the standard edition Early Access Alpha that crashes perpetually and $250 for the "Collectors Edition" that does not include the game but does include a ~~2 cent floppy disk~~ very-expensive-i-would-never-lie-to-you 1 GB flash drive full of crappy and unimaginative JSON universe files for the game and a little square-with-a-dot-in-the-middle figurine that I 3d printed for 3 cents. Don't forget, you will be able to order the Sergeant Dude skin pack and the Fat Lobster skin pack and the Shameless Bastard skin pack for $90 a pop the same day you buy the game, and after being an alpha tester, you will get a 1 penny discount on the full game once it releases 3000 years from now if you order it in floppy disk form (200 floppies arriving at your door) rather than buying it normally. Oh, and you'll buy the full version only to realise that the game is hidden inside a lootbox and you have to buy each lootbox for $20 and each key for each lootbox for $15 everytime you want to open one, and you have to open the lootboxes until you find the actual game inside of one of them. Preorder the game today for $1000 or the collectors edition for $5000 to get a 50% discount on the Sergeant Dude discount that's only valid on launch day but won't really work because all of the "servers" will be down for a week and you will need to access these "servers" to open the game.

<sup><sub>And that was when you realized that you just blew several hundred bucks on a shitty 2d No Man's Sky clone</sub></sup>
